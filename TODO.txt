Todo: 
Mobile App:
	Classifying screen should just be 1 Artist
	Should learn how to separate into 9 overlapping parts (input image) 
		then serve image to respective segment
	Error if cancel (fix)
	Only shows imgs[0], [1] or [2] not, length of imgs is right (9)

CLassifying:
	make java to read image from mobile app (check cabalio's code)
	make separate code for training, supposed to show when activate 
		(like when it learns), check cabalio's code
